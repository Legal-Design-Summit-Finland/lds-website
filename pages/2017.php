				<h4>9:00 Welcome Words</h4>

				<h4>1. Legal Design Beyond Visualization</h4>
				<blockquote>
					<p>9:15 - 9:45 <strong>Legal Design Beyond Visual Design: Creating Service, Org, and System Change</strong><br><span class="small"><strong><a href="#margaret-hagan" class="scroll-to">Margaret Hagan</a></strong> (Director of the Legal Design Lab, Stanford Law School)</span></p>

								<h4>The main abstract will be this:</h4>
								<p>Legal Design is at a crossroads. Often lawyers start engaging with design only in terms of visuals and communication — how to make documents look better and function more efficiently. There are more ambitious types of legal design though — redesigning not just single work products, but entire services, organizations, and systems. In this presentation, I will lay out a vision of how legal designers may expand their ambitions to more complex design projects, that can make our legal system fundamentally more human-centered.</p>

								<h4>Designed to Deliver</h4>
								<p>Whether you’re summarizing or trying to grasp the essence of complicated legal information, visualization is an incredibly powerful method of getting a message across convincingly, clearly and quickly, while improving both comprehension and retention. But is there a difference between introducing design in the legal world and legal design? We -at Houthoff- believe the differentiating element is adding behavioral psychology to the mix. In this keynote Sarah van Hecke will provide some insights on how legal design is defined and used at on of the top Dutch law firms while outlining how this combination of disciplines (lawyer, legal design consultant, designer) can create interesting and unexpected solutions.</p>

								<h4>Between Art and Science: Building a Purposeful Legal Innovation Agenda:</h4>
								<p>Legal Tech is ubiquitous. Attorneys from private, in-house and public sectors are now confronted with a wide array of tools and solutions that claim imminent integration into routine legal practice standards.  But investing in new solutions, from vetting and procurement to internal alignment of skills and processes, is no small task. Marie shares her no-nonsense perspective on adoption of legal innovation, so that strategic interest, not buzz, prevails.</p>

						<div id="abstract-koponen" class="hidden">
							<div class="inline-content">
								<p>Understanding the basics of information design is not only useful for creating better legal documents – visualizations and other visual presentations can be used to help convince the judge and jury during a trial as well. We will look at examples relating to both civil and criminal cases to see how a clear visual presentation of facts can help support arguments made in court.</p>

						<div id="abstract-kilpi" class="hidden">
							<div class="inline-content">
								<p>The new technological environment of business is marked by conflicting constraints and value-creating relationships that change rapidly and constantly. It is a complex environment. In complex environments, the way to vitality and resilience is a continuous recombination of successful elements to create new versions, some of which may thrive.</p>
								<p>As a result, the operating system of work is starting to change in a radical way. Success is based on continuous redefinition of the organization itself. It is about recombining options and contributions in a competitive and cooperative network environment.</p>
								<p>The concept of economic space represents a new logic of organizing based on neither the traditional market nor a process. Whereas processes involve relations based on dependence and markets involve relations based on independence, the new economic spaces involve relations of dynamic interdependence.</p>
								<p>Post-blockchain smart contracts make possible, in economically viable ways, that person A can be part in the work/learning of person B. B again plays part in the work/learning of person C, who plays part in the work/learning of A. Work is by default networked cognition. Value creation is event-based and contextually highly interdependent cooperation.</p>

								<p>Nobody reads privacy policies. They are long, difficult, tedious legal documents. However, the law requires individuals to be informed about how their personal data is handled and competent about their privacy preferences. So how can legal requirements and actual users’ behaviors be reconciled? The forthcoming General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) suggests icons to convey data practices in a more understandable manner. I will present a framework where legal semantic web technologies interact with visualizations and human-centered design, with the aim of helping individuals to flow through the complexity of privacy information and to exercise more control over their data</p>
