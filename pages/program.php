For the last ten years I have had the privilege of being Chief Judge at the District Court of Helsingborg. It´s really a benefit since the court is both modern and efficient. I have also taken part in several law-making processes as head of or expert in many State Inquiries on different legal subjects. Courts are very important in democratic legal systems. The courts and the judges should therefore take part in the public debate and the society. Of course, Justice must not only be done, it must also be seen to be done. To me, this means that the courts and the judges must always stay unbiased but it does not prevent the courts and the judges from explaining the legislation or a sentence and it does not prevent the courts and the judges to stand up for
human rights. To me it´s natural that courts and judges engage in social media and why not in a Pride parade?</p></div>

His key interest in academia has been in enhancing legal education. Michael is the academic lead for Teaching and Learning at his law school and a former Chair of the Association of Law Teachers. His colleagues and I have used service design methods, such as UX interviews, user personas, a uniform icon set and journey mapping to completely redesign our undergraduate curriculum. I have researched and published on environmental law, on human rights and am author of Public Law (2nd edn, Routledge, 2018). I am the creator of OpenLawMap, an interactive site for mapping places of legal interest. I led a project with a graphic designer on visualising tenant’s rights project. My current research projects are examining Legal Design as a nascent academic discipline and on how the anthropological and sociological constructions of Law and of Design can interact. At its heart, the project is looking at the tensions and innovative opportunities of bringing design mindsets into legal culture.</p></div>
