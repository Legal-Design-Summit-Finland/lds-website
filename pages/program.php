Andrea discovered Legal Design when she stumbled across one of Margaret Hagans sketches from a Courts Technology Conference in September 2017 on How courts could become more innovative. In March 2019 Helsingborg District Court arranged Sweden’s first legal design workshop in the public sector with representatives from the Swedish Enforcement Authority, the Swedish Prosecution Authority, the Swedish Police, members of the Swedish Bar Association, the City of Helsingborg, the Swedish Agency for Participation and the Swedish Prison and Probation Service.</p></div>

						<div class="bio"><p class="small">Ylva Norling Jönsson has worked as a judge for more than twenty years. For the last ten years she has worked as the Chief Judge at the District Court of Helsingborg, a court that is both modern and efficient. Ylva has taken part in several law-making processes as the head of or the expert in many State Inquiries on different legal subjects. Ylva thinks that courts and the judges should take part in the public debate and the society, as they play an important role in the legal system. Justice must not only be done, it must also be seen to be done. To Ylva this means that the courts and the judges must always stay unbiased but it does not prevent the courts and the judges from explaining the legislation or a sentence and it does not prevent the courts and the judges to stand up for human rights. Ylva finds it natural that courts and judges engage in social media - and why not in a Pride parade too?</p></div>

Together with co-founders Pieter-Jan Franssen en Daan Vansimpsen, the aim of Ethel (also check out the brand story which refers to Ethel Rebecca Benjamin, one of the world very first female lawyers) is to innovate law, make it more attractive, and kickstart the next revolution in the legal landscape. Matthias founded the legal consultancy firm “theJurists” (deJuristen) in 2010. In 2017 he created Europe’s first b2b legal chatbot. After managing the firm for almost 10 years, he sold his shares to an investor, and now he’s fully committed to Ethel. Aside from legal tech & design, Matthias is a privacy activist and director of the Ministry of Privacy, which combats privacy invasions committed by our governments (the famous ‘fingerprint on the eID’-case in Belgium), a legal storyteller at DOBBELAERE-WELVAERT, and - as an avid fan of motorcycles - the official Triumph Motorcycles Mobility Ambassador.</p></div>
